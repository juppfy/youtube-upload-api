# YouTube Upload API - Environment Variables
# Copy to .env when deploying (e.g. Railway): cp .env.example .env

# Server port (Railway sets this automatically - leave as 3000 for local dev)
PORT=3000

# ---
# Why only PORT? No YouTube secrets go here.
#
# This API receives YouTube credentials per-request in the POST /upload body:
#   - oauthToken: from n8n's YouTube OAuth credential or a previous node
#   - uploadUrl: from the YouTube resumable setup (Location header)
#   - videoUrl: URL to download the video from
#
# In n8n: do NOT use the HTTP node's "Authentication" / OAuth. Instead,
# pass oauthToken inside the JSON body. See docs/N8N-WORKFLOW.md.
